\label{sec:lower}

In what follows, we show lower bounds for node-private estimation. Our bounds apply not only to the particular measure of distance on distributions used in defining node-differential privacy, but to any measure of distance that implies that two distributions cannot be reliably distinguished. 

\begin{definition}
  A randomized algorithm $A$ is node-TV-stable if for all graphs $G$
  and $G'$ that differ by the rewiring of one vertex, the
  distributions of $A(G)$ and $A(G')$ are $\tfrac 1 3$-close in
  \emph{total variation distance} (or statistical difference).
\end{definition}
